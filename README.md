## Keldra Smith-Junkere 

Having worked successfully in health communications and scientific research for 5 years, I decided to embark on a journey to turn my passion for coding into a full-time career. 

In 2021, I was awarded a scholarship to Makers Academy, where I undertook a 12-week intensive bootcamp to hone my skills in software development. 

I am now in pursuit of a role within a company that aligns with my core values, as well as an enriching environment to further support me as a Full Stack Developer.
